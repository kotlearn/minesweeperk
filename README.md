# MinesweeperK: A Compose Multiplatform Minesweeper Game

Welcome to the **MinesweeperK** project! This repository accompanies
the [Kotlearn YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS8XpdV-mvE&list=PL5GuNM-e28OX5DTcc1QZRHKozB71htnqJ),
where we build a Minesweeper game using **Compose Multiplatform**. The game runs on **Android**,
**iOS**, and **desktop** platforms (Windows, macOS), following **clean architecture** and
a **multi-module project structure**.

### Episodes

Each episode of the series has its own branch, which represents a **snapshot** of the project at the
end of that episode. This allows you to easily explore or download the code relevant to any specific
video.
